## What is JAXB?
JAXB stands for Java Architecture XML Binding. It is a tool that is used by Java developers to map Java to XML representations. Today, JAXB  is also  known as Jakarta XML binding.<br/><br/>

## The two main features/operations of JAXB are: 
- **````Marshalling```` -> converting a Java Object into XML** 
- **```` Unmarshalling```` -> converting XML to a Java Object** 
<br/><br/>  
## Removal of JAXB from the Java JDK:
JAXB became a part of the JDK in Java 6. In Java 11 (2018), JAXB was removed from the JDK. 
- JAXB is still a part of the JDK in Java 6,7, and 8.
- JAXB is still a part of Java 9 and 10 but it has been disabled or not included in the module path. 
- In Java 11 it is completely removed.

Versions exist:  JAXB 1.0 &  JAXB 2.0, Jakarta 3.0<br/><br/>

## Since it has been removed:
JAXB (Jakarta XML Binding) can still be utilized. To do so, you will need to use the following dependencies. 
We learned that different versions of the dependencies will require different import statements. 

```Java

<!-- JAXB API only -->
  <dependency>
      <groupId>jakarta.xml.bind</groupId>
      <artifactId>jakarta.xml.bind-api</artifactId>
      <version>3.0.0</version>
  </dependency>

  <!-- JAXB RI, Jakarta XML Binding -->
  <dependency>
      <groupId>com.sun.xml.bind</groupId>
      <artifactId>jaxb-impl</artifactId>
      <version>3.0.0</version>
      <scope>runtime</scope>
  </dependency>

``` 
<br/>

## Example 1: Simple XML File (simple)
  - This is the XML we will be Unmarshalling & Marshalling.
  ````XML
  <?xml version="1.0"?>
  <credentials>
      <host>woz.cs.missouriwestern.edu</host>
      <port>33006</port> <!--This isn't the right port, by the way -->
      <user>csc</user>
      <password xhint="room where woz is located It definitily is not '!ðŸ˜ˆæ¹¯ðŸ¦ŠðŸš´'">********</password>
  </credentials>
````
#### Unmarshalling (XML to Java Object)
  - Step 1: We will need to create a POJO with JAXB Annotations.
  ```Java 
import jakarta.xml.bind.annotation.XmlElement;
import jakarta.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement;

@XmlRootElement( name = "credentials" )
public class Credentials {

  //Create fields for every xml attribute and element
  private String host;
  private String port;
  private String user;
  private Password password;
  
  //Create constructor and pass in all elements
  public Credentials(String host, String port, String user, Password password) {
    this.host = host;
    this.port = port;
    this.user = user;
    this.password = password;
  }

  //To make JAXB work, we need a no-arg constructor
  public Credentials() {};

  //Any element with annotations need to be objects with their own annotations.
  
  //Always put XML annotations for elements above the setter for each field.  
  @XmlElement( name = "host")
  public void setHost(String host) {
    this.host = host;
  }
  public String getHost() {
    return host;
  }
  
  /* --- REMAINING GETTERS & SETTERS --- */
  
  /* --- TO STRING --- */
    //I would suggest making a toString so that you can easily read & print the object.
} //End of Credentials class.

```
- Step 2: Create another class so that we can grab the 'xhint' attribute.
Explanation: maybe aaron should explain this...
````XML
 <password xhint="room where woz is located It definitily is not '!ðŸ˜ˆæ¹¯ðŸ¦ŠðŸš´'">********</password>
````
````Java
import jakarta.xml.bind.annotation.XmlAccessType;
import jakarta.xml.bind.annotation.XmlAccessorType;
import jakarta.xml.bind.annotation.XmlAttribute;
import jakarta.xml.bind.annotation.XmlValue;

@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)
public class Password {
  @XmlAttribute(name = "xhint")
  private String xhint;

  @XmlValue
  private String pass;

  public String getPass() {
    return pass;
  }

  public void setPass(String pass) {
    this.pass = pass;
  }

  public String getXhint() {
    return xhint;
  }

  public void setXhint(String xhint) {
    this.xhint = xhint;
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return "Password{" +
        "xhint='" + xhint + '\'' +
        ", pass='" + pass + '\'' +
        '}';
  }
}
````
-  Step 3: Unmarshalling in the main.
```Java
public static void main( String[] args ) {

        //try-catch catches JAXBException
        try {
            //This is an example of unmarshalling with a simple XML
            //Here we are reading it in from a local file.
            File simpleXML = new File("zz_woz.xml");
            JAXBContext jaxbContext = JAXBContext.newInstance(Credentials.class);
            Unmarshaller jaxbUnmarshaller = jaxbContext.createUnmarshaller();
            Credentials credentials = (Credentials) jaxbUnmarshaller.unmarshal(simpleXML);
            System.out.println(credentials);
         } catch (JAXBException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            System.exit(1);
        } //End of catch.
    } //End of main.
````
- Credentials printed to console:
````Java

````

#### Marshalling (Java Object to XML)
  - When we marshal we will use the above Credentials and Password classes.

````Java
public static void main( String[] args ) {

 //try-catch catches JAXBException
  try {
       //This is an example of taking that same object and marshalling it into an xml file with a simple XML
            Password password = new Password();
            password.setPass("Bad Pass");
            password.setXhint("Best hint ever");
            Credentials newCredentials = new Credentials(
                "missouriwestern.edu",
                "587398",
                "Team Awesome",
                password
            );
            jaxbContext = JAXBContext.newInstance(Credentials.class);
            Marshaller jaxbMarshaller = jaxbContext.createMarshaller();
            jaxbMarshaller.setProperty( Marshaller.JAXB_FORMATTED_OUTPUT, true );
            jaxbMarshaller.marshal( newCredentials, new File ("newCredentials.xml"));
            jaxbMarshaller.marshal( newCredentials, System.out);

        } catch (JAXBException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            System.exit(1);
        }
    }
````
- Output in 'newCredentials.xml' file:
````XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<credentials>
    <host>missouriwestern.edu</host>
    <password xhint="Best hint ever">Bad Pass</password>
    <port>587398</port>
    <user>Team Awesome</user>
</credentials>
````

## Nested XML File (complex)
#### Unmarshalling (XML to Java Object)
  - We will be loading the XML from this [url](https://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/KSTJ.xml). The url contains the local weather in the form of nested XML.
  - POJO code
  - Main code
#### Marshalling (Java Object to XML)
  - POJO code
  - Main code
  - Output in console

<br/>

## Example 3: Array Expressed as XML (complex)
#### Unmarshalling (XML to Java Object)
  - We will be loading the XML from this [url](https://civilserviceusa.github.io/us-states/data/states.xml). The url contains a collection of states in the form of nested XML.
  - **Step 1:** We will need to create a limited-type POJO for each individual state. 
  ````Java
  /**
 * This class represents a single state object.
 */

public class State {

    /* --- DATA --- */
    //These data fields directly correspond to the XML tags found in the above url.
    private String state,slug,code,nickname,website,
            admission_date,admission_number,capital_city,
            capital_url,population,population_rank,constitution_url,
            state_flag_url,state_seal_url,map_image_url,
            landscape_background_url, skyline_background_url,
            twitter_url, facebook_url;

    /* --- TO STRING --- */
    //I would suggest making a toString so that you can easily read & print the object.
    ...

    /* --- ALL GETTERS & SETTERS --- */
    ...
 
} //End of State class.
  ````
  - **Step 2:**  We will also need a class that represents the collection of States. This class will contain the @XMLAnnotations. Because ArrayList is a part of the collection framework, and does not have any JAXB annotations, we need to have this seperate class to represent the set of objects.
   ````Java
import jakarta.xml.bind.annotation.*;
import java.util.List;

@XmlRootElement(name = "states")
@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)

public class States {

    @XmlElement(name = "state")
    private List<State> states = null;

   /* --- GETTER FOR LIST --- */
    public List<State> getStates() {
        return states;
    } //End of getStates

    /* --- SETTER FOR LIST --- */
    public void setStates(List<State> states) {
        this.states = states;
    } //End of setStates.

} //End of States class.
  ````
  - **Step 3:**  Now let's get to unmarshalling! First let us create a function that will take in the address, load and unmarshall the content from the url, and give us an ArrayList of the State Objects. 
  ````Java
    public static ArrayList<State> loadToObject(String address) {
        ArrayList<State> stList = new ArrayList<State>();
        try {
            //Setting to the new instance of the XML Annotated class.
            JAXBContext jaxbContext = JAXBContext.newInstance(States.class);
            //Creating the URL to read from address.
            URL url = new URL(address);
            //Creating the Unmarshaller.
            Unmarshaller jaxbUnmarshaller = jaxbContext.createUnmarshaller();
            //Unmarshalling the URL and mapping it to the XML Annotated class States.
            States sts = (States) jaxbUnmarshaller.unmarshal(url);
            //For each state inside the States List, sts.getStates(), print out its corresponding data and add to ArrayList.
            for(State st : sts.getStates()) {
                System.out.println(st);
                stList.add(st);
            } //End of for/each.
            //JAXBContext.newInstance() throws an Exception.
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
            System.exit(1);
        } //End of generic catch.
        return stList;
    } //End of loadToObject.
  ````
  - **Step 4:** Setting the address in main and calling our newly created function.
   ````Java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //Putting the web address into a String.
        String address = "https://civilserviceusa.github.io/us-states/data/states.xml";
        //Loading from the website and printing the ArrayList of State objects we created.
        loadToObject(address);
     } //End of main.
  ````
  - Output in console (Note: the above code will print all State objects added to the ArrayList, which is all 50, I will only be showing one of the printed state objects printed in the console).
  ````Java
  //Remember that the way it is printed into the console will be determined by your toString().
 State{state='Alabama', slug='alabama', code='AL', nickname='Yellowhammer State', website='http://www.alabama.gov/', admission_date='1819-12-14', admission_number='22', capital_city='Montgomery', capital_url='http://www.montgomeryal.gov/', population='4833722', population_rank='23', constitution_url='http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/alison/default.aspx', state_flag_url='https://cdn.civil.services/us-states/flags/alabama-large.png', state_seal_url='https://cdn.civil.services/us-states/seals/alabama-large.png', map_image_url='https://cdn.civil.services/us-states/maps/alabama-large.png', landscape_background_url='https://cdn.civil.services/us-states/backgrounds/1280x720/landscape/alabama.jpg', skyline_background_url='https://cdn.civil.services/us-states/backgrounds/1280x720/skyline/alabama.jpg', twitter_url='https://twitter.com/alabamagov', facebook_url='https://www.facebook.com/alabamagov%27%7D}
  ````
  <br/>
  
#### Marshalling (Java Object to XML)
  - We will be loading the Java Objects, which will be our State Objects, into a local .xml file (I call my file 'toXML.xml'). 
  - **Step 1:** Creating a method that takes in a set of States.
  ````Java
  public static void loadToXML(States states) {
        try {
            JAXBContext jaxbContext = JAXBContext.newInstance(States.class);
            Marshaller jaxbMarshaller = jaxbContext.createMarshaller();
            //Setting the XML format, to make it easy on the eye. 
            jaxbMarshaller.setProperty(JAXB_FORMATTED_OUTPUT, true);
            //jaxbMarshaller.marshal(states, System.out); <- This prints to console
            //Notice that we marshal using the states, which is a collection of states. 
            jaxbMarshaller.marshal(states, new File("toXML.xml")); // <- this prints to the toXML.xml file
        } catch (JAXBException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            System.exit(1);
        } //End of catch.
    } //End of loadToXML.
  ````
  - **Step 2:** Call the function in main.
  ````Java
 public static void main(String[] args) {
        //Putting the web address into a String.
        String address = "https://civilserviceusa.github.io/us-states/data/states.xml";
        //I did not want to type (manually set) all the data, so ...
        //I store the ArrayList returned from Unmarshalling in this ArrayList of State objects.
        ArrayList<State> stList = loadToObject(address);
        //Then I create a new set of states....
        States sts = new States();
        //and set the collection of states to the State Objects list (which is the ArrayList of State Objects).
        sts.setStates(stList); //Rmember we ArrayList does not work with XML annotations it is important that you 
        //use the ArrayList and set the List in the States class. If you try to use the ArrayList you will get an error.
        loadToXML(sts);
    } //End of main method.
  ````
